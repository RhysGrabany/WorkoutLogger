Features include:

  1. Allowing the logging of up to 10 exercises
  2. Allowing the logging of the users daily weight
  3. Up to 5 sets per exercise
  4. Saving a template for quick and easy logging
  5. Ability to look at older dates to see how the user performed that day

This is my first application created in C#, as such there may be design implmentations that could be questionable.

Thank you for your understanding, this will be more filled out as development continues
